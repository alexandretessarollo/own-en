The Cretaceous-Tertiary Conventional Oil and Gas Assessment Unit (AU 50340201) is an established AU that produces oil and gas mainly from sandstone reservoirs associated with anticlinal traps around the margins of the Bighorn Basin and along the Five Mile trend (figure 44); however, many of these accumulations have a stratigraphic component where sandstone reservoirs pinch out across structure (Hafenbrack and others, 1958; Stone, 1975; Tonnsen, 1985; Cardinal and others, 1989; Bartow-Campen, 1986; Keefer, 1998; Talbot, 1996).
The AU encompasses approximately 7,900 mi2, occupies the entire areal extent of the Cretaceous-Tertiary Composite TPS, and includes reservoirs ranging from the Lower Cretaceous Cloverly Formation through the Paleocene Fort Union Formation (figures 7, 44).
The first discovery was from the Frontier Formation in 1906 at Garland field (Cardinal and others, 1989).
The AU is heavily explored and since the initial discovery at Garland field nearly 12,000 wells have been drilled, including about 1,700 wells producing from Cretaceous or Tertiary reservoirs.
To date, nine oil fields and 15 gas fields (NRG Associates, 2007) greater than the minimum grown field size of 0.5 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBOE) have been discovered, with a minimum cumulative production of 94 MMBO and 833 BCFG gas (figure 45) (IHS Energy Group, 2007).
Input data for the assessment is shown on the Seventh Approximation form in Appendix G.
The minimum and maximum number of oil accumulations greater than the minimum field size of 0.5 MMBO expected to be discovered are one and 15, respectively, with five most likely (mode).
The estimated size of the oil accumulations ranges from 0.5 to 12 MMBO with a median value expected to be 1.5 MMBO.
The minimum and maximum number of gas accumulations greater than 3 BCFG expected to be discovered are 1 and 40, respectively, with a mode of 10.
The estimated size of these gas accumulations ranges from 3 to 72 BCFG, with a median value expected to be 9 BCFG.
Few of these new discoveries are likely to be from structural accumulations, as most anticlinal features in the basin have been explored with only one accumulation greater than the minimum field size being discovered in the last 50 years despite an increase in exploration activity (figures 45, 46).
Some new fields may be discovered in subthrust areas where petroleum could be trapped beneath the overhang of major thrust faults that flank parts of the basin (Gries, 1981, 1983b).
However, future discoveries will more likely be from stratigraphic traps in the Frontier Formation and Cody Shale, where sandstone reservoirs pinch out updip on anticlinal noses (Keefer, 1998) or into marine shales along the basin flanks, or are draped over structures (Fox and Dolton, 1996).
These accumulations are expected to be small in size because larger traps likely would have been discovered by the high drilling density that has occurred around the margins of the basin (figure 47).
Additional accumulations may also be from stratigraphic traps from valley-fill sandstones in the Muddy Sandstone and the Greybull Sandstone Member of the Cloverly Formation (Dolson and others, 1991; Fox and Dolton, 1996).
The mean estimates for undiscovered oil and gas resources that have potential for additions to reserves in the Cretaceous-Tertiary Conventional Oil and Gas AU (50340201) are 13 MMBO and 221 BCFG; tabulated assessment results are summarized in table 1.
