The Cretaceous-Tertiary Composite Total Petroleum System (TPS) produces oil and natural gas mainly from sand- stone reservoirs in anticlinal traps around the margins of the Bighorn Basin, Wyoming and Montana.
The reservoirs range from Early Cretaceous to Paleocene in age and are sourced by organic-rich Lower and Upper Cretaceous marine shales that contain both Type-II oil-prone and Type-III gas-prone organic matter, and by Upper Cretaceous and Paleocene coals that contain Type-III organic matter.
New resource potential is expected to be mainly from conventional stratigraphic traps and from unconventional continuous-type accumulations.
The Cretaceous-Tertiary Composite TPS is subdivided into (1) three basin-centered gas assessment units (AU)-Muddy-Frontier Sandstone and Mowry Fractured Shale Continuous Gas AU (50340261), Cody Sandstone Continuous Gas AU (50340263), and Mesaverde Continuous Gas AU (50340264); (2) one fractured shale oil accumulation-Mowry Fractured Shale Continuous Oil AU (50340262); (3) two coalbed gas accumulations-Mesaverde- Meeteetse Coalbed Gas AU (50340281) and Fort Union Coalbed Gas AU (50340282); and (4) one conventional oil and gas AU-Cretaceous-Tertiary Conventional Oil and Gas AU (50340201).
The Cretaceous-Tertiary Conventional Oil and Gas AU (50340201) and the Muddy-Frontier Sandstone and Mowry Fractured Shale Continuous Gas AU (50340261) both have established production; the other AUs have no production and are considered hypothetical.
The mean estimate for undiscovered oil and gas resources that have potential for additions to reserves from Cretaceous and Tertiary rocks in the Bighorn Basin is about 18 million barrels of oil, 771 billion cubic feet of gas, and 5 million barrels of natural gas liquids.
The Bighorn Basin Province (5034) is a large sedimentary and structural basin that formed during the Laramide orogeny (Late Cretaceous through Eocene).
The basin covers approximately 10,400 mi2 in north-central Wyoming and a small part of south-central Montana (figure 1).
The basin is structurally bounded on the northeast by the Pryor Mountains, on the east by the Bighorn Mountains, and on the south by the Owl Creek Mountains.
The north margin as defined in this report includes a zone of faulting and folding referred to as the Nye-Bowler lineament (Wilson, 1936).
The northwest and west margins are formed by the Beartooth Mountains and Absaroka Range, respectively.
The earliest commercial hydrocarbon production from Cretaceous reservoirs in the basin was established at Garland field (1906) and Greybull field (1907) (Fox and Dolton, 1996).
Since then, cumulative production from Cretaceous and Tertiary reservoirs is about 94 million barrels of oil (MMBO) and 830 billion cubic feet of gas (BCFG), primarily from sandstone reservoirs associated with anticlinal traps around the margins of the basin (figure 1).
The purpose of this report is to describe the geologic framework and petroleum geology, and to assess the undiscovered oil and gas resources of the Cretaceous and Tertiary rocks in the Bighorn Basin.
