The Jurassic Smackover Interior Salt Basins Total Petroleum System includes three conventional Travis Peak– Hosston assessment units: Travis Peak–Hosston Gas and Oil (AU 50490205), Travis Peak–Hosston Updip Oil (AU 50490206), and Travis Peak–Hosston Hypothetical Updip Oil (AU 50490207) (pl 8).
A fourth assessment unit, the Hosston Hypothetical Slope-Basin Gas Assessment Unit (AU 50490208), was identified but not assessed owing to a lack of petroleum geologic data.
This assessment unit has a moderate exploration drilling history (pls 6–8).
Oil and gas fields exceeding the minimum size of 0.5 million barrels of oil or 3 billion cubic feet of gas (0.5 MMBO or 3 BCFG) occur in this assessment unit downdip from the Travis Peak–Hosston Updip Oil Assessment Unit (AU 50490206).
The updip assessment-unit boundary is located at the northern limit of known gas fields that attain the minimum size (pls 6–8).
The southern assessment-unit boundary is located where sandstone reservoirs of fluvial and deltaic origin decrease in abundance downdip along the Early Cretaceous shelf-slope edge (figure 3).
The assessment unit lies entirely within the Jurassic Smackover Interior Salt Basins Total Petroleum System and has a probability of 1.0 that undiscovered fields of minimum size or larger exist (appendix 1).
On the basis of data from the database “Significant Oil and Gas Fields of the US” (NRG Associates, 1999), we identified 163 fields as producing from the Travis Peak– Hosston Gas and Oil Assessment Unit.
Of these 163 fields, 108 were classified as gas fields and 8 were classified as oil fields.
The remaining fields were not classified as either gas or oil in the NRG database.
Field discovery dates for these NRG fields range from 1904 to 1995.
New field discoveries peaked at 60 during the 1970s.
Mean gas field size is 96.8 BCFG, and mean oil field size is 2.9 MMBO.
All fields together have a grown ultimate recoverable resource of 23.3 MMBO and 10.46 TCFG.
Carthage, with an estimated recoverable volume of 1,041 BCFG, is the largest field.
A median of 50 undiscovered gas accumulations and four undiscovered oil accumulations are expected to exist.
The median undiscovered field sizes are 10 BCFG and 0.75 MMBO (appendix 1).
The sizes and numbers of undiscovered accumulations presented in appendix 1 are strongly related to sedimentologic and diagenetic interpretations in which accumulations of oil and gas occur primarily in meandering-channel, tidal channel, and tidal-flat facies in the upper part of the Travis Peak with preferential diagenetic alteration.
Drilling depths range from 5,600 to 18,000 ft for undiscovered gas fields and from 5,600 to 14,800 ft for undiscovered oil fields.
The assessment unit covers an area of 66,282 mi2.
This assessment unit has a moderate exploration drilling history (pls 6–8) and the presence of primarily oil fields exceeding the minimum size (0.5 MMBO) updip from the Travis Peak–Hosston Gas and Oil Assessment Unit (AU 50490205) (pls 6–8).
The updip boundary occurs in east Texas, southeastern Oklahoma, northern Louisiana, central Mississippi, central Alabama, and the westernmost part of the Florida panhandle where the Travis Peak Formation has been eroded or was not deposited.
The southern assessment-unit boundary is defined by the occurrence of producing fields of the Travis Peak–Hosston Gas and Oil Assessment Unit.
The assessment unit lies entirely within the Jurassic Smackover Interior Salt Basins Total Petroleum System.
Forty-five fields were identified as producing from the Travis Peak–Hosston Updip Oil Assessment Unit through the use of the database “Significant Oil and Gas Fields of the U.S.” compiled by NRG Associates (1999).
Of these 45 fields, 39 were classified as oil fields and 2 were classified as gas fields.
The remaining fields were not classified as either gas or oil in the NRG database.
Field discovery dates for these NRG fields range from 1930 to 1997.
New field discoveries peaked during the 1950s when 17 fields were discovered.
Mean oil field size is 4.2 MMBO, and mean gas field size is 8.7 BCFG.
All fields together have a grown ultimate recoverable resource of 166.8 MMBO.
Raleigh field, with an estimated total recoverable volume of 32.6 MMBO, is the largest field.
The median undiscovered field size is 1 MMBO and 6 BCFG.
The sizes and numbers of undiscovered accumulations for the Travis Peak–Hosston Updip Oil Assessment Unit are related to sedimentologic and diagenetic interpretations in which accumulations of oil and gas occur primarily in meandering-channel, tidal channel, and tidal-flat facies in the upper part of the Travis Peak Formation that have preferential diagenetic alteration.
Quality of reservoir rocks deteriorates updip where nonmarine facies dominate and thermal maturities are lower than in the main producing trends farther south.
Drilling depths range from 1,970 to 16,400 ft.
The assessment unit covers an area of 31,109 mi2.
The existence of this assessment unit is based on a modest record of exploration drilling and the presence of oil shows updip from the Travis Peak–Hosston Updip Oil Assessment Unit (AU 50490206) (pls 6–8).
No fields larger than the minimum size are present, and thus this assessment unit is classified as hypothetical.
The updip boundary is located at the edge of the outcrop belt of Travis Peak reservoir rocks in east Texas, southeastern Oklahoma, northern Louisiana, central Mississippi, central Alabama, and the westernmost part of the Florida panhandle (pls 6–8).
The southern assessment-unit boundary is defined by the occurrence of producing fields of the Travis Peak–Hosston Updip Oil Assessment Unit.
The assessment unit lies entirely within the boundary of the Jurassic Smackover Interior Salt Basins Total Petroleum System.
This assessment unit has been risked for charge (0.95) and adequate reservoir rocks, traps, and seals (0.8).
The assessment-unit probability of having a field of the minimum size is 0.76 (appendix 1).
A median of four undiscovered oil accumulations are expected to exist.
The median undiscovered field size is 0.9 MMBO (appendix 1).
The sizes and numbers of undiscovered accumulations for the Travis Peak–Hosston Hypothetical Updip Oil Assessment Unit are related to sedimentologic and diagenetic interpretations in which accumulations of oil occur primarily in meandering-channel facies in the upper part of the Travis Peak Formation with preferential diagenetic alteration.
The quality of reservoir rocks deteriorates updip because nonmarine facies dominate and thermal maturities are lower than those in the main producing trends farther south.
Drilling depths range from 1,970 to 7,870 ft.
The assessment unit covers an area of 38,896 mi2.
A summary of the assessment results for the three assessed Travis Peak–Hosston assessment units by resource type (that is, crude oil, natural gas, and natural gas liquids) is presented in table 2.
The mean total estimated undiscovered conventional gas resource for Travis Peak–Hosston reservoirs in the Jurassic Smackover Interior Salt Basins Total Petroleum System is 1,135.72 BCFG with a range of 2,038.35 (F5) BCFG to 418.19 (F95) BCFG.
This resource includes both nonassociated gas in gas fields and associated gas in oil fields.
Only 5 percent (58.93 BCFG) of the mean total gas resource value (1,135.72 BCFG) represents associated gas in oil fields.
The largest undiscovered conventional gas resource was estimated for the Travis Peak–Hosston Gas and Oil Assessment Unit (AU 50490205); this assessment unit is thought to contain a mean resource of 1,085.35 BCFG and a range of 1,930.96 BCFG (F5) to 404.69 BCFG (F95).
The mean total estimated undiscovered conventional crude oil resource for the Jurassic Smackover Interior Salt Basins Total Petroleum System in the Louisiana-Mississippi Salt Basins Province is 28.92 MMBO; the range is 58.29 (F5) MMBO to 7.44 (F95) MMBO (table 2).
The largest undiscovered conventional crude oil resource was estimated for the Travis Peak–Hosston Updip Oil Assessment Unit (AU 50490206); it has a mean resource of 20.97 MMBO and a range of 39.49 MMBO (F5) to 6.18 MMBO (F95).
The mean total estimated undiscovered conventional natural gas liquids (NGLs) resource for Travis Peak–Hosston reservoirs in the Jurassic Smackover Interior Salt Basins Total Petroleum System in the Louisiana-Mississippi Salt Basins Province is 21.54 MMBNGL; the range is 41.76 (F5) MMBNGL to 7.18 (F95) MMBNGL (table 2).
