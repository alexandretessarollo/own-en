Primary reservoir intervals are (1) the Cretaceous Villeta Formation in the Putumayo Basin, with lesser amounts of oil in the Cretaceous Caballos and Tertiary Pepino Formations, (2) the “U” and “T” sandstones of the Cretaceous Napo Formation in the Oriente Basin with lesser production from the Tena Formation and the M1 Sandstone of the Napo Formation, and (3) Cretaceous Agua Caliente, Chonta, and Vivian Formations in the Maranon Basin.
Formation ages, approximate lateral equivalents, and periods of erosion and nondeposition are shown in figure 3.
Exploration in the Oriente Basin was initiated in 1921, although it was not until 1937 that Shell Exploration drilled the first well (Tschopp, 1953).
The first listed field discovery is Orito, 1963, in the Putumayo Basin (Petroconsultants, 1996).
This is the fifth largest field in the province, with about 280 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBOE) contained in discovered recoverable reserves.
Of this, nearly 99 percent of the reserves has been produced with about 20 MMBOE remaining (Petrocon­sultants, 1996).
Reservoirs are the sandstones referred to as the X, Y, and Z sandstones of the Eocene Pepino Formation, sandstones of the Cretaceous Caballos Formation, and the “N,” “U,” and “T” sandstones of the Villeta Formation (figure 3).
Production is from structural traps that resulted from deformation of basement rocks (Mathalone and Montoya, 1995).
The largest field in the province is Shushufindi-Aguarico (1969) with approximately 1.6 billion barrels of oil equivalent (BBOE) discovered recoverable reserves (Petroconsultants, 1996).
This structural trap resulted from inversion of a north-northeast- to south-southwest-trending Late Triassic to Early Jurassic rift that emerges in the Cutucu uplift area and the Santiago Basin (figure 1) (Baby and others, 1999).
Depth of production ranges from 2,420 to 2,515 m (7,940 to 8,250 ft).
For all reservoirs across the province, reservoir average depth is 2,686 m (8,813 ft) and range of depths is from 30 to 4,150 m (90 to 13,615 m) (Petroconsultants, 1996).
There are 172 fields across the province that contain estimated ultimate recovery of hydrocarbons of greater than 1 MMBOE; 132 fields contain 1 MMBOE or greater cumulative production (Petroconsultants, 1996).
No hydrocarbon production has been reported from Paleozoic reservoirs.
At least 43 fields produce from both Lower and Upper Cretaceous reservoirs.
Reported production is frequently commingled, which must be taken into account to minimize overestimation of production and reserves for the Hollin-Napo assessment unit (60410101).
Lower Cretaceous reservoirs are productive in 65 fields.
One hundred and fifty fields have production from Upper Cretaceous and Tertiary reservoirs.
Several fields indicated production from Paleocene (2) and Oligocene (1) formations; combined, there are 11 entries for production from Paleocene and Upper Cretaceous (Maastrichtian) reservoirs.
Nineteen fields listed by Petroconsultants (1996) produce from both Upper Cretaceous and Tertiary formations.
The largest onshore fields in most basins of the U.S. are found early in the discovery history, and sizes of new fields commonly decrease through time.
This is not as apparent within the Putumayo-Oriente-Maranon province because large fields continue to be discovered.
This record of discovery results from an exploration history that is affected by access difficulties associated with the Amazon rain basin, local and national political and economic concerns, and other aspects of petroleum exploration.
The discovery history of provinces is divided into the first, second, and third thirds of the range of discovery dates for fields; for the Putumayo-Oriente-Maranon province the minimum field size is 1 MMBO known recoverable oil.
These time segments are used to help understand the discovery process in provinces.
Field size distribution of known recoverable oil (MMBO) is based on dates of discovery divided into the 1963–1974, 1974– 1988, and 1988–1995 time periods for the Mesozoic-Cenozoic TPS (figure 4).
The two largest fields, Shushufindi-Aguarico and Sacha were discovered in 1969, early in the history of exploration, but the Liberador and Ishpingo fields contain more than 300 MMB recoverable oil and were found in 1980 and 1992, respectively; this was during the last two thirds of exploration.
Median size of new field discoveries has dropped through time; median size was 23.6 MMBO during the 1963–1974 period, 9 MMBO during 1974–1988, and 6 MMBO during 1988–1995.
Table 1 lists production and geochemical statistics for oil fields in the Putumayo-Oriente-Maranon province.
Statistics are displayed for (1) the Mesozoic-Cenozoic TPS, (2) Upper Cretaceous and Tertiary reservoirs, and (3) Triassic to Lower Cretaceous reservoirs.
