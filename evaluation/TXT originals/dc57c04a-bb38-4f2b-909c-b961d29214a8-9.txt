In outcrop areas of the Bighorn Basin, thermal maturity based on vitrinite reflectance (Ro) values for coal-bearing strata range from 0.27 to 0.96 percent around the basin margins, but generally fall in the range of 0.3 to 0.5 percent (Nuccio and Finn, 1998; Finn and Pawlewicz, 2007).
In the subsurface, Nuccio and Finn (1998) presented maps showing the levels of thermal maturity for the top of the Cody Shale and the top of the Mesaverde Formation (figures 26, 27).
These maps were constructed from data collected from coal-bearing strata (outcrop and wells) in the Mesaverde, Meeteetse, Lance, and Fort Union Formations (figure 7).
Thermal maturity maps for the Cody and Mesaverde show that Ro values are less than 0.73 percent around the margins of the basin and increase basinward to greater than 1.10 percent in the deeper areas (figures 26, 27).
In the Clarks Fork sub-basin, both the Mesaverde and the Cody reach a level of thermal maturity of around 0.80 percent, and only the Cody reaches a level exceeding 1.10 percent in the northern part of the basin adjacent to the Beartooth Mountains.
The thermal maturity trends generally reflect the structural configuration of the basin, indicating thermal maturity is related to the structural development and burial history of the basin.
These levels of thermal maturity are much lower than equivalent strata in the Wind River Basin and Southwestern Wyoming Province to the south.
In the central deep part of the Wind River Basin both the Cody and the Mesaverde reach Ro levels greater than 2.0 percent and in one smaller area in the northeastern part, the Ro exceeds 3.0 percent (Johnson and others, 2007; Finn, 2007b).
In the Southwestern Wyoming Province, Johnson and others (2005) show Ro levels for strata equivalent to the Cody Shale and Mesaverde Formation exceeding 2.2 percent.
By comparison, Ro data collected by Finn and Pawlewicz (2007) in the deepest parts of the Bighorn Basin for Cretaceous strata older than the Cody Shale show values ranging to only around 1.8 percent at depths generally greater than 15,000 ft.
Petroleum generation modeling by Roberts and others (2008) indicated that the Frontier Formation and older Cretaceous rocks may have reached an Ro level of 2.0 percent only at the Emblem Bench location in the deep part of the basin, whereas, equivalent rocks reached or exceeded this level over large parts of the Wind River Basin and Southwest Wyoming Province (Nuccio and others, 1996; Roberts and others, 2004; Roberts and others, 2007).
