The Fort Union Formation Coalbed Gas Assessment Unit (AU 50340282) is a hypothetical AU that is believed to have the potential to produce gas from coal beds in the Fort Union Formation.
The AU encompasses approximately 3,800 mi2 in the central part of the Bighorn Basin (figure 43).
The lower limit of the AU is defined as the area where coal beds are interpreted to be present at depths of 6,000 ft or less; coal beds at greater depths were not considered due to the potential decrease in permeability with increasing depth.
The upper limit of the AU is defined as the base of the outcrop of the Fort Union Formation.
Fort Union coals have been mined since the late 1800s, and an estimated 30-40 million tons of coal were produced from the Red Lodge area (figure 43) until the 1950s (Rawlins, 1986).
More recent mining has taken place in the Grass Creek area (figure 43), where some 300,000-400,000 tons of Fort Union coal were mined between 1989 and 1993 (Resource Data International, 1998).
Coal and carbonaceous shale beds are common in Fort Union Formation outcrops; the 36-ft- thick Mayfield coal bed in the Grass Creek area is the thickest coal bed identified in the Bighorn Basin (Hewitt, 1926).
Near Manderson and in the southeastern part of the basin, isolated coal beds in outcrops range from 10 to 15 ft thick, although most are lenticular.
In the Red Lodge area, coal beds range from less than 4 ft to 12 ft in thickness (Woodruff, 1907; Rawlins, 1986).
In most other areas, exposed coal beds are generally thin (< 5 ft thick) (Roberts, 1998).
Based on limited data from oil and gas exploration wells, cumulative (total) coal thicknesses in the Fort Union Formation in the subsurface range from 3 to 26 ft; the maximum individual coal bed thickness measured in well logs is 11 ft (figure 43) (Johnson, 1998).
In many wells throughout the basin, no coal beds were identified.
The apparent rank of Fort Union coal is subbituminous (Glass and others, 1975), and thermal maturity (R0) values for coal in the AU range from about 0.36 percent to about 0.87 percent in the deep basin adjacent to the Oregon Basin thrust fault (Nuccio and Finn, 1998; Finn and Pawlewicz, 2007).
The AU is considered hypothetical because there is currently no production of coalbed gas from the Fort Union Formation in the basin (WOGCC, 2007).
To date, there have been no published reports of coalbed gas tests, although indirect evidence of gas (methane?) in Fort Union coals may be represented by the 1943 gas explosion in the Smith Mine in the Red Lodge-Bear Creek coal field, Montana (Rawlins, 1986).
Input data for the assessment of AU 50340282 is shown on the FORSPAN ASSESSMENT MODEL FORM in Appendix F.
The minimum and maximum areas for the AU are 2,177,000 and 2,661,000 acres, respectively, with a calculated mean of 2,419,000 acres.
This wide range in acreages reflects uncertainty in determining the depth to and (or) the presence of Fort Union coal beds in many areas, due to the lack of definitive drill-hole data.
The estimated minimum and maximum percentages of the untested AU area that has potential for additions to reserves are 0.1 and 3 percent, respectively, with a calculated mean of 1.4 percent, and a mode of 1.0 percent (Appendix F).
The minimum area restricts coalbed gas potential to the Red Lodge-Bearcreek area (figure 43), where there are as many as 8 mapped coal beds in a 32-mi2 area; total coal reserves have been estimated in excess of 600 million tons (Woodruff, 1907; Rawlins, 1986).
The median estimate includes the Red Lodge-Bearcreek area coupled with an area downdip from coal outcrops near Manderson, where individual coal beds in Fort Union outcrops are locally as thick as 10 ft.
The maximum estimate includes the minimum and median areas, and additional untested areas in the east-central part of the basin northwest and southwest of Manderson (figure 43).
Coalbed gas wells producing from coal in the Fort Union Formation (Tongue River Member) in the Powder River Basin, Wyoming, were used as analogs (Flores, 2004) for estimating cell size (drainage area) and total recovery per cell for untested cells (EURs) because of general similarities in coal rank (subbituminous coal) and thermal maturity; however, coal maturities in some areas of the Bighorn Basin exceed the thermal maturity of Powder River Basin coals.
The minimum, median, and maximum total recoveries per cell for untested cells having potential for additions to reserves are estimated at 0.02, 0.08, and 1.0 BCFG, respectively, with a calculated mean of 0.1 BCFG (Appendix F).
These estimates are based on EURs for coalbed gas wells producing from the 20- to 30-ft-thick Anderson and Canyon coal beds in the Powder River Basin.
Only the Mayfield coal bed in the Grass Creek area is comparable in thickness (figure 43), but is limited in areal extent and not buried deep enough (overburden < 200 ft; Stewart, 1975) to be prospective for coalbed gas.
Elsewhere in the Bighorn Basin, Fort Union coal beds generally range from less than 5 ft to 12 ft in thickness.
Although no direct correlation has been made between coal thickness, gas content, and enhanced production, greater coal volumes associated with thicker coal beds should result in a greater volume of coalbed gas per unit area of land (for example, see Choate and others, 1984).
Based on this concept, we interpret EURs for untested cells in AU 50340282 should be somewhat less than those of Fort Union coalbed gas wells in the Powder River Basin.
A minimum EUR of 0.02 BCFG was applied to untested cells in AU 50340282, a value generally considered as representative of the minimum gas recovery required for a successful well.
A median EUR of 0.08 BCFG and a maximum EUR of 1.0 BCFG were also applied to untested cells.
Because of the differences in coal bed thicknesses as discussed previously, these EURs are less than EURs from Powder River Basin coalbed gas wells, which have median recoveries ranging from 0.13 to 0.17 BCFG and maximum recoveries ranging from 1.2 to 1.3 BCFG (Troy Cook, written commun., 2007).
The estimated minimum and maximum areas per cell of untested cells having the potential for additions to reserves are 40 and 200 acres, respectively, with a calculated mean of about 113 acres, and a mode of 100 acres.
A 40-acre cell size was used at the minimum because of the potential for interference between wells producing at a closer spacing.
A 100-acre cell size (median estimate) is considered optimal in regard to gas volume and recovery, dewatering considerations, and reduction (or omission) of interference between adjacent wells.
The maximum of 200 acres considers the potential for increased drainage areas in exceptionally continuous and permeable coal reservoirs.
The estimated mode and maximum cell sizes used in this assessment are slightly larger than estimated cell sizes for untested cells in the Powder River Basin (Flores, 2004), because the slightly higher thermal maturity of Fort Union coal in the Bighorn Basin might enhance the permeability due to better cleat development in the more mature coal.
The mean estimate for undiscovered gas resources that have potential for additions to reserves in the Fort Union Formation Coalbed Gas Assessment Unit (50340282) is 32 BCFG; tabulated assessment results are summarized in table 1.
