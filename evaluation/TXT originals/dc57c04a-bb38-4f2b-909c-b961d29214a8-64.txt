This world assessment used the TPS as the basis for constraining the assessment unit (AU).
The TPS is the essential elements (source, reservoir, seal, and overburden rocks) and processes (generation-migration-accumulation and trap formation) as well as all genetically related petroleum that occurs in seeps, shows, and accumulations (discovered and undiscovered) whose provenance is a pod or closely related pods of active source rock.
The TPS is the essential elements (source rock, reservoir rock, seal rock, and overburden rock) and processes (generation-migration-accumulation and trap formation) as well as all genetically related petroleum that occurs in seeps, shows, and accumulations, both discovered and undiscovered, whose provenance is a pod or closely related pods of active source rock.
The TPS is a naturally occurring PS-5 hydrocarbon-fluid system in the lithosphere that can be mapped, and includes the essential elements and processes needed for oil and gas accumulations to exist.
The TPS concept presumes that migration pathways must exist, either now or in the past, connecting the provenance with the accumulations.
The assessment unit (AU) is a volume of rock within the TPS that encompasses fields, discovered and undiscovered, sufficiently homogeneous in terms of geology, exploration strategy and risk characteristics to constitute a single population of field characteristics with respect to criteria used for resource assessment.
