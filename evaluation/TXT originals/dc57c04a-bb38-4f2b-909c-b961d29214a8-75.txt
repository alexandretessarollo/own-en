The Mentawa Reefal Build-up member and Minahaki carbonate sequences are the main hydrocarbon bearing reservoir of the Senoro field, in the Senoro-Toili Block,Central Sulawesi of the eastern Indonesia, especially in the Banggai- Sula basin.
Carbonate reservoir of Mentawa member of Minahaki Formation  commonly recognized as pinnacle reef build up type which were growth  on the structural  high areas and having orientations relatively northeast to southwest direction, following the tectonic setting in the areas.
On the other hand, the platform carbonate which is most identified as globigerinids wackstone and globigerinids packstone facies spread out dominantly in the deeper areas  enveloping the higher areas as the places of carbonate build-up (in back reef and open marine area).
The data measurement of routine core analysis of the carbonate reef build-up having porosity and permeability values ranges from good to excellent classes.
Whereas, in the carbonate platform type, the porosity indicated good to very good classes, nevertheless the permeability value turn out to be commonly low and having a very contrast value.
Existence of secondary macro-porosity, which produce from dissolution in conjunction with micro inter-crystalline porosity were build within micro-crystalline calcite, micro-sparite and micro-limpid dolomite, are exist in almost throughout carbonate sequence reefal facies and platform, those interpreted as the main factors controlling improvement carbonate reservoir quality in this region.
The reservoir qualities are slightly difference among northern and southern areas of the Senoro structures.
In the northern area, the carbonate Mentawa Member (reefal facies) has evolved significantly better reservoir quality comparing to carbonate of  Minahaki (platform facies).
This is caused the reefal facies has high distribution macro porosity such mouldic, vuggular and honeycomb porosities and conjugation with micro-inter-crystalline porosity are develop within micro-sparite (an average crystal size 12 micron) interpret encourage increasing porosity end permeability in significant value.
