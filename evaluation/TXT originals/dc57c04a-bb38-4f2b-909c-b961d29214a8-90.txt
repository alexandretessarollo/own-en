An assessment unit (AU) is a mappable volume of rock within a Total Petroleum System (TPS) that contains known or postulated oil and gas accumulations that share similar geologic characteristics (Klett and others, 2000).
The Cretaceous-Tertiary Composite TPS (503402) is subdivided into seven AUs.
Three are identified as basin-centered gas accumulations (BCGA): the Muddy-Frontier Sandstone and Mowry Fractured Shale Continuous Gas AU (50340261), the Cody Sandstone Continuous Gas AU (50340263), and the Mesaverde Continuous Gas AU (50340264).
One fractured shale oil accumulation, the Mowry Fractured Shale Continuous Oil AU (50340262), and two coalbed gas accumulations: the Mesaverde-Meeteetse Coalbed Gas AU (50340281), and the Fort Union Coalbed Gas AU (50340282) were defined.
One conventional AU was defined, the Cretaceous-Tertiary Conventional Oil and Gas AU (50340201).
The Cretaceous-Tertiary Conventional Oil and Gas AU (50340201) and the Muddy-Frontier Sandstone and Mowry Fractured Shale Continuous Gas AU (50340261) both have established production; the remaining five AUs have no production and are considered hypothetical.
(Note: the coding numbers follow the worldwide coding system used by the USGS).
