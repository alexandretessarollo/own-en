Rocky Mountain reservoirs are a mix of structural and stratigraphic traps, whereas oil and gas fields in this province are structural or structural with a stratigraphic component, such as updip pinchout of facies.
Strata in the Rocky Mountain region also do not exhibit the thinskinned tectonics that are characteristic of the Mesozoic section in the Putumayo-Oriente-Maranon province.
Mathalone and Montoya (1995) believed the Upper Cretaceous Vivian Formation to be the most important reservoir zone of the Peruvian sub-Andean basins, including the Maranon Basin.
The Vivian Formation is generally a single sandstone body, but thickens into a series of sandstones as much as 150 m (490 ft) thick in northeastern Maranon Basin (Mathalone and Montoya, 1995).
Its counterpart in the Oriente Basin of Ecuador is the Napo M-1 sandstone (figure 3) (Mathalone and Montoya, 1995).
Thickness of the Villeta, Napo, and Villeta-Agua Caliente intervals across the Putumayo-Oriente-Maranon province is as much as 900 m (2,950 ft) and averages about 300 m (984 ft) (S. Rushworth, Consultant, written commun., 1998).
Primary depositional environments of these sandstones are fluvial and nearshore marine.
Cretaceous Villeta-Napo-Agua Caliente reservoirs have average and median porosity of 17 percent and maximum porosity of 26.4 percent based on 104 core samples; median and maximum permeabilities are 642 and 6,000 milli­darcies (mD), respectively, for 68 samples (Petroconsultants, 1996).
Reservoir permeabilities are commonly more than 1,000 mD.
Primary seals are formed by overlying as well as interbed­ded Cretaceous and Tertiary shales.
Strong water drive increases recoveries to greater than 40 percent of the original oil in place (Mathalone and Montoya, 1995).
Oil is produced mainly from Cretaceous nonmarine sandstones with subordinate amounts in Tertiary clastic reservoirs.
Oil produced from basal Tertiary sedimentary rocks is primarily due to leakage along faults and fractures from Cretaceous formations (Mathalone and Montoya, 1995).
Gas-oil ratio (GOR) of production for 71 entries from 50 fields across the Putumayo-Oriente-Maranon province ranges from 12 to 2,000 cubic feet of gas per barrel of oil (CFG/BO) with a median of 160 CFG/BO (Petroconsultants, 1996).
Production from reservoirs of Late Cretaceous to Tertiary age in 25 fields exhibit GOR of 12 to 1,060 CFG/BO with a median of 160 CFG/BO.
Gas-oil ratio for 19 Lower Cretaceous reservoirs ranges from 15 to 2,000 CFG/BO with a median of 450 CFG/ BO.
Some “oil fields” have considerable gas production.
API gravity of oils from Upper Cretaceous and Tertiary reservoirs and for Triassic to Lower Cretaceous reservoirs is shown in figure 5. Average and median API gravity for 347 samples from numerous fields across the province is 24.3° (table 1) (GeoMark, 1997).
Crude oil with API gravity of about 22° to 31° is listed as medium gravity, while 31° to 55° characterizes light gravity oils (figure 5).
Oils from Lower Cretaceous reservoirs are generally lighter weight than those of Upper Cretaceous and Tertiary reservoirs; respective median API gravities are 29° and 21°.
This difference may result largely from location in the basin—oil production from Lower Cretaceous reservoirs is largely along the western boundary of the basin, west of the productive areas of Upper Cretaceous and Tertiary reservoirs.
Oil gravity commonly increases to the east as water washing and biodegradation of oils becomes more prevalent, although biodegradation of oil near the western boundary of the province can result from in.ux of water from the west.
The reported percentage of sulfur in produced oil for 222 fields within the Putumayo-Oriente-Maranon province ranges from 0.03 to 3.21 percent, with a median of 0.76 percent (table 1); a subset of this data for 81 fields that contains no duplicate samples has listed median and average sulfur values of 0.61 percent and 0.93 percent, respectively (GeoMark, 1997).
Median sulfur value of 32 oils from Lower Cretaceous reservoirs is 0.96 percent and the median value for 77 samples from Upper Cretaceous rocks is about the same (1.0 percent).
Low-sulfur oils are characterized as containing 1 percent or less (Tis-sot and Welte, 1984).
Sulfur percentages varied somewhat for duplicate samples within oil fields.
An example is the San Jacinto field in the Maranon Basin, where six Cretaceous oils ranged from 0.39 to 1.71 percent S.
Samples in most oil fields exhibited less variation than this, for example, the Corrientes field of the Maranon Basin, where 15 samples of oils from Cretaceous formations ranged from 0.35 to 0.5 percent S; probable hydrocarbon source rocks were Cretaceous and Permian marine shales.
