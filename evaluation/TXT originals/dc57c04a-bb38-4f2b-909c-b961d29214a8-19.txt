This report summarizes the economic analysis of the U.S. Geological Survey's 2005 petroleum assessment of the Central North Slope of Alaska.
The study area is located east of the National Petroleum Reserve Alaska (NPRA) and west of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR).
It extends from the State-Federal offshore border south to the Brooks Range (figures 1 and 2).
The study area includes all onshore lands (State, Federal, and Native) and the lands underlying adjacent Alaska-State waters.
Past discoveries in this area have already produced about 15 billion barrels of hydrocarbon liquids (more than 12 billion barrels of crude oil (BBO)).
More than 35 trillion cubic feet (TCF) of gas has also been identified to date.
Estimates of technically recoverable oil in undiscovered oil accumulations range from 2.57 to 5.85 BBO with a mean of 3.98 BBO (Bird and Houseknecht, 2005).
The range in estimated volumes corresponds to the 95 percent probability (that is, a 19 in 20 chance the actual volume will exceed that 95th fractile volume) and the 5 percent probability level (1 in 20 chance the actual will exceed 5th fractile volume), respectively.
Similarly, the 95th and 5th fractile estimates of technically recoverable gas volumes in undiscovered gas accumulations range from 23.9 to 44.9 TCF of gas with a mean value of 33.3 TCF.
The minimum sizes of the assessed accumulations were 5 million barrels recoverable oil and 100 billion cubic feet (BCF) recoverable gas.
