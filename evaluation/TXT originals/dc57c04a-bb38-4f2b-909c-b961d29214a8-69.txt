The Florida Peninsula, USGS Province 50, as defined by the 1995 USGS National Oil and Gas Assessment (Gautier and others, 1995), includes all of the State of Florida east of the Apalachicola River and the adjoining State waters; the part of the Florida panhandle west of the Apalachicola River is part of Province 49 (figure 1).
The boundary in the panhandle between Province 50 and Province 49 is a generally north-south-trending line between the counties of Gadsden, Liberty, and Franklin to the east and the counties of Jackson, Calhoun, and Gulf to the west.
Province 50, inclusive of State waters, is approximately 150 mi wide and about 400 mi long totaling about 60,000 mi2.
It is bounded to the north by the State boundary with Georgia and to the east, south, and southwest by the boundaries of Florida State waters.
The State water boundaries extend to 10.36 statute miles on the Gulf of Mexico side of Florida and to 3 miles on the Atlantic Ocean side (the Gulf-Atlantic boundary line extends westward from the Marquesas Keys along lat 24°35'N., and then turns southward, just west of the Dry Tortugas, along the 83rd west meridian) (figure 1).
Six conventional hydrocarbon plays were delineated in the South Florida Basin of Province 50 (figure 2) for the purposes of the 1995 USGS National Oil and Gas Assessment (Gautier and others, 1995; Pollastro and Viger, 1998).
The Upper Sunniland Tidal Shoal Oil play (5001) and the Lower Sunniland Fractured “Dark Carbonate” Oil play (5002) are confirmed plays.
At the time of the 1995 National Oil and Gas Assess-ment, about 103 million barrels of oil (MMBO) had been produced from these known plays.
The remaining four plays in the 1995 assessment are hypothetical.
They are the Dollar Bay Shoal-Reef Dolomite Oil play (5003), the Lower Cretaceous Carbonate Composite Oil play (5004), the Extended Upper Sunniland Tidal Shoal Oil play (5005), and the Wood River Dolomite Deep Gas play (5006).
The easternmost portion of the Smackover Alabama/ Florida Updip Oil play (4911) also extends into the Florida Peninsula Province but has been assigned to the Louisiana-Mississippi Salt Basins Province 49; therefore, this play is not shown or defined in this report.
About 370 MMB of undiscovered oil were estimated in the assessment using a play-based methodology from the five plays of the South Florida Basin; an additional 57 and a half billion cubic feet of gas (BCFG) or 10 million barrels of oil equivalent (MMBOE) were estimated as gas in oil fields (table 1).
Most of the 370 MMBO was from the Lower Cretaceous Sunniland Formation with the two Upper Sunniland Tidal Shoal Oil plays (5001, 5005) estimated to contain 281 million barrels of undiscovered oil.
In 2000, the South Florida Basin was again assessed using the total-petroleum-system method, an approach to assessment of undiscovered oil and gas outlined in detail by the U.S. Geological Survey World Energy Assessment Team (2000).
In the total-petroleum-system method, the assessment unit (a subset of the total petroleum system) is used rather than the play as the basic unit to assess the volume of undiscovered oil and gas.
The results of the 2000 USGS assessment of the South Florida Basin using the total petroleum system are described in an accompanying report on this CD-ROM.
