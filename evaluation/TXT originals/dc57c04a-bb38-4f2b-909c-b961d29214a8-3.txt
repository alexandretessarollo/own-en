The Niobrara Continuous Gas Assessment Unit (AU 50370362) is a hypothetical assessment unit that is believed to have the potential to produce natural gas from fractured carbonate-rich reservoirs in the Niobrara Formation and equivalent rocks.
The gas is self-sourced and believed to have originated from the thermal cracking of self-sourced oil within the Niobrara Formation.
The gas AU encompasses approximately 3,800 mi2 of the western half of the Niobrara TPS and is located in the deeper downdip parts of the Sand Wash, Washakie, and Great Divide Basins (figure 15).
The eastern boundary of the gas AU is defined by the 1.35 percent Ro contour, the level of thermal maturity that is commonly believed to be the bottom of the oil window and the level at which oil begins to thermally crack to gas (Law, 2002; Hunt, 1996).
The southern boundary of the gas AU is defined by the Axial Basin uplift (figure 1).
The western boundary of the AU is the western limit of the Niobrara facies in the subsurface as mapped by Barlow and others (1994) and coincides with the western boundary of the Niobrara TPS.
Good-quality top seals are provided by the soft plastic shales of the overlying Mancos and Steele Shales that act as a barrier for vertical migration; thus, the gas AU is restricted stratigraphically to the Niobrara interval.
The Niobrara Continuous Gas Assessment Unit (AU 50370362) is characterized as a continuous-type (unconventional) accumulation with the characteristics of an indirect basin-centered gas system (BCGS) as defined by Law (2000, 2002).
Some of the characteristics of the Niobrara Continuous Gas Assessment unit that are attributes of an indirect BCGS include: 1. Oil-prone source rock; 2. Pressure mechanism - oil cracking; 3. Top of BCGS greater than 1.3-1.4 percent Ro; 4. Abnormally pressured.
Reservoir pressures reported for the Twin Buttes field in the northern part of the Great Divide Basin indicate a pressure gradient for the Niobrara reservoir of 0.28 psi/ft (Kendell, 1979); 5. Good quality top seal.
Little exploration has taken place within this gas AU because throughout most of the AU the top of the Niobrara occurs at depths ranging from 12,000 to greater than 22,000 ft in the deep troughs of the Sand Wash, Washakie, and Great Divide Basins (figure 15).
According to IHS Energy Group (2001) database, only two fields produce or have produced natural gas from single wells in the Niobrara or equivalent strata: (1) the Twin Buttes field located in the northern part of the Great Divide Basin, and (2) the Shell Creek field located along the southern flank of the Cherokee ridge (figure 15).
During the late 1970s, the Twin Buttes field produced natural gas from what is now a single shut-in well in the Niobrara at depths greater than 13,000 ft.
Cumulative production in this well was nearly 11 MMCF with no oil or water production reported.
The Shell Creek field currently produces natural gas from a single well in the Niobrara at depths greater than 15,000 ft, with a cumulative production through 1999 of approximately 226 MMCF, 3,694 barrels of water, and no oil.
Potential for future discoveries in this AU would most likely be "sweet spots"ù associated with fracture development located along major structural elements such as the Cherokee ridge and the Wamsutter arch.
The Niobrara Continuous Oil Assessment Unit (AU 50370361) covers approximately 4,600 mi2 in the eastern portion of the SWWP (figure 14).
Input data for the assessment are shown on the FORSPAN ASSESSMENT MODEL FORM in the Appendix.
The minimum, median, and maximum areas, in acres, for the AU are 2,622,000, 2,914,000, and 3,205,000 acres, respectively.
The reason for the uncertainty is because the position of the 1.35-percent Ro isotherm, the western boundary of the AU, is based on sparse Ro data.
The AU is mostly untested with only 337 wells penetrating the Niobrara section for a median percentage of 2 percent of the total AU area tested.
Of the 337 tested cells, 133 were identified as producers for a historical success ratio of 40 percent.
This success ratio might have possibly been higher, but due to the under≠pressured nature of the Niobrara reservoirs it is believed that many potential producers were bypassed because conventional drilling muds may have caused formation damage or masked shows in the Niobrara.
The minimum, median, and maximum percentages of the untested AU area that has potential for additions to reserves in the next 30 years are 2, 5, and 8 percent, respectively (see Appendix).
The median area represents potential fracture ("sweet spots"ù) development associated with known anticlinal and synclinal trends, faults and fault zones, and plunges of folds, identified from published geologic and structure maps (Love and Christiansen 1985; Tweto, 1976, 1979; Barlow and Haun, Inc., 1997).
These areas would most likely occur in areas where thermal maturities range from 0.60 to 1.35 percent Ro.
The maximum area would include additional unidentified subtle structures and regional lineaments (Maughan and Perry, 1986; Thomas, 1971).
The minimum area accounts for fractures that contain vein-filling minerals, thus resulting in a loss of permeability and nonproductive reservoirs (Vincelette and Foster, 1992).
Graphs showing the estimated ultimate recovery (EUR) distribution for Niobrara wells are shown in figure 16.
Figure 16a shows the distribution for all wells, and figure 16b shows the distribution by discovery thirds.
The number of wells in each discovery third is the same, but the time span represented for each third may be different.
The median EUR for all wells is 55,000 barrels of oil (BO) with a maximum of 1,600,000 BO.
Median EURs for the first, second and third discovery thirds are 150,000, 60,000, and 20,000 BO (Appendix), respectively.
Lower EURs for the second and third thirds most likely reflects interference among infill wells drilled at closer than optimal spacing.
The minimum, median, and maximum total recovery per cell for untested cells having potential for additions to reserves over the next 30 years is 1,000 BO, 80,000 BO, and 1,600,000 BO, respectively (Appendix).
The median of 80,000 BO is lower than that of the historical first third of 150,000 BO because we suggest that many of the best locations were drilled early, but is higher than the median for the second and third discovery thirds because we believe that if new wells are drilled outside areas of established production,they will not experience interference problems.
The minimum, median, and maximum area per cell of untested cells having the potential for additions to reserves in the next 30 years is 40, 160, and 400 acres, respectively.
This wide range in drainage areas reflects the variable production that can be typical of many fractured reservoirs.
Variable production in these wells is due to the rapid lateral changes in fracture intensity caused by lithologic variations, fault intensity, and tectonic setting (Vincelette and Foster, 1992).
Tabulated results for the Niobrara Continuous Oil Assessment Unit for undiscovered oil, gas, and natural gas liquids that have potential for additions to reserves in the next 30 years are summarized in table 1.
The Niobrara Continuous Gas Assessment Unit (AU 50370362) was not quantitatively assessed because of the lack of production data or a suitable analog.
