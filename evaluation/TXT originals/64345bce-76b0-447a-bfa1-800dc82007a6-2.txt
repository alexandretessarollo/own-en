The 1002 area of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge lies in the frontal part of the northward-vergent northeastern Brooks Range fold and thrust belt which constitutes the northeastern salient of the Brooks Range (Rattey, 1985; Kelley and Foland, 1987; Wallace and Hanks, 1990; Hanks, 1993; Wallace, 1993) (Figure BC1).
Blind thrust faults and folds that deform Cenozoic strata characterize the structures found throughout all but the northwestern part of the 1002 area (Bruns and others, 1987; Potter and others, Chapage BD).
The deformation is dominantly thinskinned, but thick-skinned structures involving Proterozoic to Mesozoic rocks are exposed throughout the mountains that border the southern boundary of the 1002 area (Wallace and Hanks, 1990; Hanks, 1993; Wallace, 1993).
Shortening in the northeastern Brooks Range thrust system, estimated to be less than 100 km (Wallace and Hanks, 1990; Hanks, 1993; Wallace, 1993), is significantly less than that estimated for the older Jurassic and Cretaceous Brooks Range orogen which lies to the south along the axis of the Brooks Range (e.g., Moore and others, 1994).
Despite overall similarities in stratigraphy and structural position, the western and eastern parts of the 1002 area display some notable differences along strike.
These include: 
Seismic basement in the west forms a platform that lies at a depth of about 4-5 km but descends abruptly to a level of about 7-8 km to the east (Grow and others, Chapage NA, Figure NA1).
Although lying at a generally deeper level, seismic basement in the east includes significant, doubly plunging basement-involved uplifts, the Niguanak and Aurora dome structural highs, that rise to a depth of as little as 2.5 km (Grow and others, Chapage NA, Figure NA1).
Similar uplifts are not present in the western part of the 1002 area.
Lithic foredeep strata (i.e., the Brookian sequence) that record orogenic unroofing to the south consist of units spanning Cretaceous to Quaternary time in the west.
To the east, Brookian strata are apparently dominated by latest Cretaceous and Paleocene deposits that total more than 3 km in thickness (Bird, Chapage GG).
The deformation front lies onshore in the western 1002 area, but trends northeasterly to an offshore position over 125 km north of the eastern part of the 1002 area (Grantz and others, 1990).
As a result, thinskinned structures are extensive throughout the entire eastern part of the 1002 area but are restricted to the southern part of the 1002 area to the west.
Although the southwestern part of the 1002 area is strongly deformed, complex deformation patterns and locally poor quality of seismic data in the eastern part of the 1002 area make it more difficult to unravel thinskinned deformation in the east relative to the west.
There are significantly more wells and outcrops that provide stratigraphic and structural control in the west than are available to the east in the 1002 area.
Several wells in the Canning River region and offshore provide ties to seismic lines in the adjacent western part of the 1002 area and allow a relatively robust understanding of the geology there.
In addition, numerous field studies conducted in the Sadlerochit and Shublik Mountains south of the western part of the 1002 area (e.g., Knock, 1987; Mull, 1987; Leiggi, 1987; Robinson and others, 1989; Kelley and Foland, 1987; Crowder, 1990; O’Sullivan and others, 1993; Wallace, 1993) furnish abundant information on the stratigraphic and structural architecture present in the western part of the 1002 area.
Well data in the eastern part of the 1002 area, in contrast, are restricted to the Aurora-1 well located north of the eastern 1002 area in the Beaufort Sea.
A second well, the KIC Jago River-1 well (Figure BC2), was drilled near the mouth of the Niguanak River but its findings remain confidential.
Relevant outcrop studies to the south are restricted to Reiser and others, 1980; Buckingham (1987); Eckstein (1993), and Hanks (1987, 1988, 1989, 1990, 1993), although regional studies by Detterman (1974, 1984), Detterman and others (1975), Molenaar and others (1987), LePain and others (1994), Homza and Wallace (1997) provide some additional stratigraphic and structural information on the area.
Cole and others (Chapage SM) have constructed a north-south balanced cross section and kinematic and thermal model in the western part of the 1002 area.
Their cross section, drawing on the earlier balanced cross section of Wallace (1993), uses outcrop, well, and reprocessed seismic data not previously available.
In this chapter, I provide a balanced cross section for the eastern part of the 1002 area as a companion to the balanced section of Cole and others (Chapage SM).
As did Cole and others, I have drawn on an older balanced section (Hanks, 1990, 1993) and used seismic data recently reprocessed for the assessment of the oil and gas potential of the 1002 area reported in this volume.
In addition, well data from the Aurora well located east of the northern end of the section (Figure BC2) are used as a guide to the stratigraphy in the northern part of the section.
The purpose of constructing the balanced section discussed in this paper is to provide a geometrically constrained cross-sectional model of the geologic relations in the eastern part of the 1002 area.
This section can be compared with that of Cole and others (Chapage SM) to the west to understand along-strike variations in the stratigraphy and structure of the 1002 area and the history of sedimentation, deformation, and petroleum generation.
In addition to revising the earlier section of Hanks’ (1990, 1993) in light of the new seismic and well data, this paper provides the first retrodeformable model for Brookian strata in the eastern part of the 1002 area.
The cross section offers an integrated kinematic model for the structural evolution of the 1002 area and adjacent parts of the northeastern Brooks Range fold-and-thrust belt, revises Hanks (1990, 1993) estimate of shortening in the region, and is intended to serve as an aid to the evaluation of exploration plays and prospects in the 1002 area.
Because this part of the 1002 area is characterized by complex and inhomogeneous structure, poor stratigraphic control in outcrop and subsurface, absence of marker beds, and abrupt facies changes, the cross section should be considered to be only a simplistic model compared with the actual geologic relations present along the profile.
Nonetheless, the simplifications and assumptions detailed below are important because they highlight areas where more information is required.
The cross section extends northward over a distance of 142 km from a point at the southern margin of the Demarcation Point 1:250,000 quadrangle, about 60 km south-southeast of the 1002 area (N69° 00’, W142° 30’), to a point about 15 km north of the mouth of the Jago River in the Beaufort Sea (N70° 15’, W143° 14’) (Figure BC2; Plate BC1).
This transect is nearly coincident with the sections of Reiser and others (1980) and Hanks (1990, 1993), follows seismic lines 85-50 and 84-40 in the 1002 area, and terminates in the Beaufort Sea at seismic line 719 of Grantz and others (1982).
Major structural features crossed by the transect in the northeastern Brooks Range south of the 1002 area include, from south to north, (1) Bathtub syncline, a key erosional remnant of Cretaceous sediments in the core of the northeastern Brooks Range; (2) Mt. Greenough antiform in which lower Paleozoic and Proterozoic rocks are exposed; (3) “the Wall” (Eckstein, 1993) synform, which exposes the Ellesmerian sequence in a tight syncline; and (4) Aichilik River antiform, a second area of exposure of Proterozoic(?) and Lower Paleozoic rocks (Reiser and others, 1980; Wallace and Hanks, 1990) (Figure BC2).
Upper Paleozoic and Mesozoic rocks (the Ellesmerian sequence) are exposed on the north flank of the Aichilik River antiform at Leffingwell Ridge, which forms the range front of the northeastern Brooks Range.
To the north under the coastal plain are additional major structural features, including: (1) Okerokovik River monocline, which marks a regionally significant change in structural relief in the subsurface; (2) Sabbath Creek syncline, a composite syncline developed in the Brookian sequence; (3) Aichilik high, a thinskinned culmination that bounds the Sabbath Creek syncline; (4) Niguanak high, a subsurface high defined at the top of seismic basement; (5) Jago Ridge, a thinskinned culmination developed above the Niguanak high; and (6) Aurora dome, a second subsurface high defined at the top of seismic basement (Bruns and others, 1987; Grow and others, Chapage NA, Figure NA1; Potter and others, Chapage BD, Figure BD2) (Figure BC2).
The Niguanak high and Aurora dome are large structures that were considered to have extremely high potential for oil and gas during the previous U.S. Geological Survey and Bureau of Land Management assessments (Dolton and others, 1987; Callahan and others, 1987).
Although well offshore, the northern end of the transect is more than 100 km south of the deformation front of the northeastern Brooks Range foldbelt, which lies in the continental rise of the Canada basin (Grantz and others, 1990, profile 9B).
From exposures at elevations of more than 2200 m in the northeastern Brooks Range, lower Paleozoic rocks dip northward to a depth of more than 6100 m beneath the Sabbath Creek syncline (Grow, Chapage NA) indicating a structural relief on the order of 8300 m along the transect.
Bedrock exposures are abundant in the Brooks Range in the southern part of the transect and regional structures are reasonably well constrained by the mapping of Reiser and others (1980) and by Hanks (1987, 1988, 1989, 1993) in the Leffingwell Ridge area.
The northern part of the transect lies on the coastal plain, where there are few exposures, and the adjacent submarine Beaufort shelf.
Interpretations in this area are based principally on reprocessed depth sections of seismic lines 85-50 and 84-40 (Figure BC2).
Line 85-50 was previously published as a time section in Bird and Magoon (1987, plate 4; see also, Grow and others, Chapage NA, Figure NA3), and a line drawing of this seismic line is shown on Plate BC1.
Line 84-40 remains proprietary and thus a line drawing of it is not included on Plate BC1.
Other constraints on interpretations of the northern part of the profile are proprietary shot-hole paleontologic data, proprietary and publicly available vitrinite reflectance results (Bird and others, Chapage VR), offshore seismic data of Grantz and others (1982, 1987, 1990), and paleontologic and thickness data from the Aurora well (Paul and others, 1994; M.B. Mickey, written comm. to M. Keller, 1997; Nelson and others, Chapage WL, Plate WL8).
The interpretation presented here also draws from the observations presented in Grow and others (Chapage NA), Potter and others (Chapage BD), and Cole and others (Chapage SM).
