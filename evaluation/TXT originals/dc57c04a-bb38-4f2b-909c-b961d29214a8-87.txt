The Cody Sandstone Continuous Gas Assessment Unit (AU 50340263) is a hypothetical AU that is believed to have the potential to produce gas from low permeability marine sandstone reservoirs in the upper part of the Cody Shale (figure 7).
It encompasses approximately 660 mi2 in the central part of the Bighorn Basin (figure 35).
The north, east, and south boundaries of the AU were drawn, using sparse well data to generally outline areas where (1) drillstem test results and (or) mud weights indicate greater than normal pressure gradients, and (2) mud logs record continuous gas shows in downdip areas along the deep trough of the basin (Johnson and Finn, 1998b).
The west boundary is projected beneath the Oregon Basin thrust fault and is drawn approximately at the cutoff of the Cody Shale in the footwall of the fault (Stone 1993; Taylor, 1998).
Drilling depths range from about 12,000 to 19,000 ft.
The AU is essentially unexplored, with only nine wells penetrating the Cody Shale section (figure 35).
Of these wells, none have reported any production from the Cody Shale; therefore, the AU is considered 100 percent untested and classified as hypothetical.
Because of this, the Cody Sandstone Continuous Gas AU (50350262) from the Wind River Basin assessment was used as an analog because of similar geologic characteristics (Johnson and others, 2007).
Input data for the assessment is shown on the FORSPAN ASSESSMENT MODEL FORM in Appendix C.
The minimum and maximum areas for the AU are 378,000 and 462,000 acres, respectively, with a calculated mean of 420,000 acres.
The reason for the wide range is because of the structural complexity along the Oregon Basin thrust fault at the west side and the small amount of well data used to determine the other boundaries.
The minimum and maximum percentages of the untested AU area that have potential for additions to reserves are 0.3 and 19.6 percent, respectively, with a calculated mean of 7.6 percent (see Appendix C).
These percentages represent well success-ratios (from the Wind River Basin analog) applied to possible "sweet spots,"ù where reservoir permeability may be enhanced by fracture development associated with Laramide compression (anticlinal trends and thrust faults) and post-Laramide extension (normal faulting).
The minimum, median, and maximum total recovery per cell for untested cells having potential for additions to reserves is 0.02, 0.2, and 5 BCFG, respectively, with a calculated mean of 0.34 BCFG (Appendix C).
These values are based on the low end of the EUR distribution of the analog AU in the Wind River Basin (Johnson and others, 2007) because of the general lack of reservoir rock in the upper part of the Cody Shale in the Bighorn Basin (figures 36, 37), and overall lower thermal maturities in the Bighorn Basin as compared to the Wind River Basin (Nuccio and Finn, 1998).
Also, most of the wells that make up the EUR distribution for the analog Cody Shale AU in the Wind River Basin are located on the Madden anticline, a large and highly fractured ìsweet spotî (fig. 36).
Based on the extensive seismic data that are available, it is unlikely that a similar ìsweet spotî is present in the Bighorn Basin (fig. 38).
The minimum and maximum area per cell of untested cells having the potential for additions to reserves is 40 and 640 acres, respectively, with a calculated mean of 280 acres.
These values are from the Wind River Basin analog and, according to Dunleavy and Gilbertson (1986), reflect the variability that is typical of many fractured reservoirs.
The mean estimate for undiscovered gas resources in the Cody Sandstones Continuous Gas Assessment Unit (50340263) that have potential for additions to reserves is 38 BCFG; tabulated assessment results are summarized in table 1.
