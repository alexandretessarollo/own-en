The assessment of the petroleum potential of the Navarro and Taylor Groups was based on the general geologic elements used to define a total petroleum system (TPS)— hydrocarbon source rocks (source rock maturation, hydrocarbon generation and migration), reservoir rocks (sequence stratigraphy and petrophysical properties), and hydrocarbon traps (trap formation and timing).
Using this geologic framework, the USGS defined five assessment units (AU) in the Navarro and Taylor Groups as parts of a single TPS, the Smackover–Austin–Eagle Ford Composite TPS: Travis Volcanic Mounds Oil AU, Uvalde Volcanic Mounds Gas and Oil AU, Navarro-Taylor Updip Oil and Gas AU, Navarro-Taylor Downdip Gas and Oil AU, and Navarro-Taylor Slope-Basin Gas AU (table 1).
The USGS assessed undiscovered conventional oil and gas for each of the AUs, resulting in estimated means of 1,682.8 billion cubic feet of nonassociated gas and associated gas in oil fields, 33.22 million barrels of oil, and 34.26 million barrels of natural gas liquids in the Smackover–Austin–Eagle Ford Composite TPS (table 1).
All of the undiscovered gas is conventional.
The Navarro-Taylor Slope-Basin Gas AU contains an estimated mean of 924.96 billion cubic feet of gas, representing about 55 percent of the total mean undiscovered gas resource (1,682.8 billion cubic feet) for the Navarro and Taylor Groups in the province.
