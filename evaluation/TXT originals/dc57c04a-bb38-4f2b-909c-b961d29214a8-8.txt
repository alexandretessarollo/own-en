The thermal maturity of rocks in and adjacent to the northern ANWR was investigated using vitrinite reflectance data from well and surface samples.
Analyses from about 1200 surface and shot-hole samples were used to produce a thermal maturity contour map which shows that thermal maturity of rocks at the surface increases southward across the 1002-area and into the Brooks Range.
Reflectance isograds have an easterly trend, similar to that of the mountain front.
Reflectance values range from less than 0.4-percent Ro in the northern half of the 1002 area to as much as 2.0-percent Ro in the south.
The zone of oil generation (0.6- to 1.3-percent Ro) occurs in a band three- to six-miles wide across the southern part of the 1002 area.
This part of the 1002 area and southward are considered prospective mostly for gas.
The southward increase in maturity is interpreted to reflect burial-heating and subsequent uplift and erosion.
Timing of structural deformation is inferred to have occurred after maximum heating.
The level of thermal maturity within petroleum accumulations near the 1002 area shows that most oil accumulations lie within or just above the uppermost part of the oil window.
Gas in the Kemik accumulation lies within the dry gas zone.
The Point Thomson gas and oil accumulation and the Kavik gas accumulation, which lie in the upper and lower parts of the oil window, respectively, seem anomalous given their hydrocarbon phases.
The anomalies may be the result of source rock variations or migration of hydrocarbons from deeper, more mature horizons.
