Production from conventional oil and gas accumulations from Cretaceous and Tertiary reservoirs is from anticlines and combination stratigraphic structural traps.
To date most of the production is from anticlinal traps that formed during the Laramide orogeny (Fox and Dolton, 1996).
These traps are mainly around the margins of the Bighorn Basin, the Nye-Bowler lineament (figure 1), and along the Five Mile trend (figure 3) (Fox and Dolton, 1989).
The anticlines are typically asymmetric, thrust-fault-bounded along their steep flanks, and in many cases produce from more than one reservoir horizon (Hafenbrack and others, 1958; Tonnsen, 1985; Cardinal and others, 1989).
Many of these traps have a stratigraphic component where lenticular or channel sandstones-such as those in the Frontier Formation, the Greybull Sandstone Member of the Cloverly Formation, and possibly the Muddy Sandstone- pinch out or are draped across structures (Anonymous, 1958; Stone, 1975; Cully, 1985; Mohl, 1989; Keefer, 1998; Talbot, 1996).
Limited drillstem test and mud log data from wells drilled in the structurally deep part of the basin indicate the presence of an overpressured basin-centered gas accumulation (BCGA) of limited extent in Cretaceous rocks and has been discussed in detail by Johnson and Finn (1998b) and Johnson and others (1999).
Surdam and others (1997) also suggested the presence of an overpressured gas compartment in the Bighorn Basin based on sonic velocity anomalies.
According to Johnson and Finn (1998b), the top of overpressuring in the main part of the basin generally is at depths between 13,000 and 17,000 ft, and in the deepest part of the basin extends from near the base of the Meeteetse Formation down to the base of the Cretaceous section (figures 23, 24, 25).
In the Clarks Fork sub-basin, the top of overpressuring starts at around 14,000 ft in the basal part of the Cody Shale and extends to near the base of the Cretaceous section (figure 24E).
Thick sections of marine shale, ranging to as much as several thousand feet of strata in the Thermopolis, Mowry, Cody, Lewis, and Bearpaw Shales and the Frontier Formation, provide good quality regional seals throughout most of the Bighorn Basin (see cross sections by Finn, Chapter 6, this CD-ROM; and Johnson, Chapter 7, this CD-ROM).
The thick marine shales are also important where they isolate marine sandstone reservoirs such as those in the Frontier Formation and the Cody Shale.
In addition, nonmarine sandstone reservoirs are interbedded with shale and mudrock deposited in coastal or alluvial plain settings that provide local seals.
The trap and sealing mechanism for BCGAs is generally believed to be formed where high water saturations are updip of gas- bearing low-permeability reservoir rocks thereby reducing the relative permeability of gas to near zero (Masters, 1979; Law and Dickinson, 1985; Spencer, 1989; Law, 2002).
Masters (1979) referred to this type of trapping mechanism as a water block, whereas Law (2002) used the term capillary pressure seal.
Fine-grained rocks in the Cloverly-Morrison interval act as a barrier to downward migration of gas out of the BCGA which helps to maintain pressure (Nelson, Chapter 5, this CD-ROM).
