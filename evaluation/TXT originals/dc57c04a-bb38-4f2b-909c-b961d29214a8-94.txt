The most important reservoir in the Cretaceous-Tertiary sequence in the Bighorn Basin is the Frontier Formation; sandstones with a minimum cumulative production of about 90 MMBO and 670 BCFG from some 1,250 wells (IHS Energy Group, 2007).
This accounts for about 96 percent of the total oil production and 80 percent of the total gas production from all Cretaceous and Tertiary reservoirs combined, and about 31 percent of the total gas and 3 percent of the total oil production from all reservoirs in the basin.
Production is from sandstone reservoirs encased in marine shale that in some cases pinch out across structures (Keefer, 1998).
The sandstones are fine- to medium-grained, locally shaly, with porosities ranging from about 4 to 34 percent and permeabilities ranging from .001 to 260 millidarcies (mD) (Shapard, 1975; Tonnsen, 1985; Cardinal and others, 1989).
The Muddy Sandstone and the Cloverly Formation are next in relative importance as reservoirs in the Cretaceous- Tertiary interval.
The Muddy Sandstone has produced a minimum of about 1.5 MMBO, and 117 BCFG from about 105 wells, accounting for about 1.5 percent of the oil and 14 percent of the gas that have been produced (IHS Energy Group, 2007).
The reservoirs are generally very fine to medium-grained sandstones, with core porosities and permeabilities ranging from 1.6 to about 23 percent, and 0.01 to 8 mD, respectively (Cardinal and others, 1989).
The Cloverly Formation has produced about 2 MMBO and 41 BCFG from about 240 wells, which accounts for about 2 percent of the oil and 5 percent of the gas produced from the Cretaceous-Tertiary section (IHS Energy Group, 2007).
The main reservoir in the Cloverly is the Greybull Sandstone Member, a fine- to medium-grained sandstone with porosities generally ranging from 5 to 20 percent (max up to 30 percent) and permeabilities ranging from 0.41 to 50 mD (max 150 mD) (Hafenbrack and others, 1958; Tonnsen, 1985; Bartow- Campen, 1986; Cardinal and others, 1989).
Additional production from the Cloverly is from the basal Pryor Conglomerate Member consisting of fine- to coarse-grained conglomeratic sandstone, and chert-pebble conglomerate, with porosities ranging from 8 to 15 percent, and permeabilities ranging to as much as 75 mD (Hafenbrack and others, 1958; Tonnsen, 1985; Cardinal and others, 1989).
Minor reservoirs include the Mowry and Cody Shales and the Mesaverde (including the Eagle Sandstone and Judith River Formation), Meeteetse, Lance, and Fort Union Forma- tions.
Combined cumulative production from these units is about 410 thousand barrels of oil (MBO) and 7 BCFG, which accounts for less than one percent of the oil and gas produced from all Cretaceous-Tertiary reservoirs in the basin (IHS Energy Group, 2007).
Reservoirs in the Mowry Shale are thin, fine-grained sandstones, referred to as the "Kimball"ù and "Octh Louie"ù sands, with reported log porosities of 13-16 percent (Cardinal and others, 1989); future potential from the Mowry might include production from fractured shale.
Reservoirs in the Cody Shale are isolated shallow marine sandstones encased in marine shale.
These beds are very fine to medium-grained, commonly blanket-like, can be traced for several miles, and appear to pinch out in marine shale in several directions.
No porosities or permeabilities have been reported.
Production from the Mesaverde and Meeteetse Formations (including the Judith River Formation) is from lenticular fluvial sandstones that have limited areal extent.
In addition, some production in the Mesaverde (including the Eagle Sandstone) is from blanket-like, marginal marine sandstones.
The sandstones are generally very fine grained, with porosities ranging from 10 to 26 percent (Shapard, 1975; Cardinal and others, 1989; Tonnsen, 1985).
Potential future production from both formations might include coal beds in the coastal plain facies of each unit.
However, as reported by Johnson (1998), coal beds have a limited distribution in the basin.
Limited production from the Lance and Fort Union Formations is from fluvial sandstone reservoirs.
Cardinal and others (1989) reported log porosities of 20-24 percent for the Lance, and 38 percent for the Fort Union, with no permeabili- ties reported.
Potential future production from the Fort Union might be coal beds.
