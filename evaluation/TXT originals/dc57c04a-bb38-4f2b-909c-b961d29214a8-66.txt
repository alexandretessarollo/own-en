The Fort Union Formation, referred to as the Polecat Bench Formation by Bown (1975) is composed of sandstone, siltstone, conglomeratic sandstone, conglomerate, carbona- ceous shale, and coal (Bown, 1975; Johnson, 1998; Keefer and others, 1998; Roberts, 1998).
The conglomerates accumulated mainly as alluvial fans along the northwest margin of the Bighorn Basin and as fluvial channel deposits where streams flowed into the basin from surrounding highlands (Hickey, 1980; Johnson and Middleton, 1990; Roberts and Stanton, 1994; Roberts, 1998).
The sandstones are very fine to coarse- grained and represent a variety of fluvial deposits, while the finer grained and carbonaceous deposits represent lacustrine and swamp deposits (Hickey, 1980; Yuretich and others, 1984; Roberts and Stanton, 1994; Hickey and Yuretich, 1997; Roberts, 1998).
The thickness of the Fort Union indicates continued subsidence of the basin trough during the Laramide orogeny and reflects the presentday structural configuration of the basin.
The formation is generally less than 1,000 ft thick around the basin margins, thins locally to about 300 ft in the north, and thickens to more than 7,500 feet in the structurally deepest central part (Moore, 1961; see Finn, Chapter 6, this CD-ROM).
In outcrops around the margins it unconform- ably overlies Lance and locally older Upper Cretaceous rocks (Bown, 1975; Love and Christiansen, 1985; Keefer and others, 1998; Roberts, 1998).
The Fort Union is Paleocene in age based on fossil pollen dating by Nichols (1998) and Roberts (1998), and by mammalian faunas reported by Gingerich (1983).
Strata that represent the lowermost Eocene in the Bighorn Basin are assigned to the Willwood Formation and consist of variegated shales, sandstones, and conglomerates (Van Houten, 1944; Bown, 1980).
The Willwood is nearly flat lying, occupies the central part of the basin, and conceals much of the structure of the underlying rocks (figure 2).
Bown (1980) reported a maximum thickness of nearly 2,400 ft in exposures in the southern part of the basin.
The lower Eocene Tatman Formation overlies and in part interfingers with the Willwood.
It is present only as isolated erosional remnants in the south- central part of the basin (Love and Christiansen, 1985; Bown, 1980), where it has a maximum thickness of nearly 900 ft, and is comprised of fine-grained sandstone and carbonaceous shale that accumulated in lakes and swamps (Van Houten, 1944).
Keefer and others (1998) and Finn (Chapter 6, this CD-ROM) report a combined thickness for the Willwood and Tatman Formations of nearly 5,000 ft in the subsurface along the deep axis of the basin.
The combined thickness of all lower Tertiary rocks ranges from less than 1,000 ft around the margins of the basin to greater than 12,000 ft near the basin axis, a pattern that reflects the presentday structure of the basin (figures 3, 17).
